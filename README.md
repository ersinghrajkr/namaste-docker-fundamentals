# Namaste-Docker-Fundamentals

#### To check docker version

`docker version`

###### To run hello-world image to check docker installation. After command is ran it will create container for "hello-world"

docker run hello-world

//"Namaste To Docker world" text will be overriden to the output of busybox container. Busybox have two programs - ls and echo.
// It means this can be run with other image because these program may not exist in other image
`docker run busybox echo Namaste To Docker world`   => Container starts and exit immediately
`docker run busybox ls`
`docker run busybox ping google.com` => Container starts and keeps running. Press ctrl+c to stop

// Now open another terminal to check whether container is running or not
`docker ps`

docker ps --all => To see all the HISTORY of conatiner ran or running( All the container ever started up)
`docker ps --all`

###### Later anytime => container can be started with conatiner-id

`docker start -a 2690a93873e5`

###### Difference between => Docker run hello-world & Docker create hello-world

`docker run hello-world`

=> By default `docker run` command will run the container and show us the logs

`docker create hello-world`  and then `docker start -a <container-id>` OR  `docker start <container-id>`

=>  `-a` means attach to the container and watch for output comming from it and printed out to my terminal. But without `-a` , it won't watch for output and prints to terminal

`docker `=> Reference the Docker client

`create` => Try to CREATE the container

`start` => Try to START the container

`<image-name>` => Name of image to use for this container

`<container-id>` => ID of container to start

### Start the container(ever ran in past )

`docker start -a <container-id>`

`docker start -a 121c976862b4`

###### Removing all the stopped container ever ran ( to free up the space )

`docker system prune`

### Retriving Log Outputs

`docker logs <container-id>`

for example: -

```
docker create busybox ping google.comdocker 

start bc452b715415e677f4a7e0f58d0c31527fbee802de1278307753b39ed1da09b6

docker logs bc452b715415e677f4a7e0f58d0c31527fbee802de1278307753b39ed1da09b6

```

### Stopping the containers gracefully

`docker stop <container-id>`

Verify the container running status from below command

`docker ps --all`

### Stopping the containers without gracefully

`docker kill <container-id>`

Verify the container running status from below command

`docker ps --all`


##### Execute an additional command in a container

`docker exec -it` `<container-id> <command>`

`docker` => Reference to the docker client

`exec` => Run another command

`-it` => Allow us to provide input to the container

`<container-id>` => ID of the container

`<command>` => Command to execute

###### Test above command with Redis:

Find the container-id of the redis  `docker ps --all`

`docker exec -it 7eb487bb11f1 redis-cli`

`127.0.0.1:6379> set myValue 5`

```
output => OK
```

`127.0.0.1:6379> get myValue`

```
output => "5"
```
